            Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages
            developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the
            number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained. DRY
            can greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a codebase.

            JavaScript is a programming language that allows users to interact
            with websites. One of its core features is variables, which store
            data types as values.

            What exactly do we mean by “truthy” and “falsy” in Javascript? A
            value is considered falsy if it is one of the following
            values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type
            with the value of false. 
          </li>
          <li>
            An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.
            Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.
          </li>
          <li>
            A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task
            on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be
            executed over and over.
          </li>
          <li>
            At the most basic level, a function is simply a set of instructions
            that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.
